# Human Resources Management System
Developed with ASP.NET MVC (.Net 6) for HR administrators, PM and company board to manage employee records, employee leaves, track performance evaluations, manage clients, leaders, projects and tasks. 
Used SQL Server as the database and Entity Framework Core to handle data.
Implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms with role-based access control, to ensure secure interactions depending on user privileges.
